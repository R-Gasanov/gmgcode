Write your commit message in the present tense and use the imperative:
"Fix bug", not "Fixed bug." or "This fixes a bug". This convention
matches up with commit messages generated by commands like git merge
and git revert.
 
Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
 - Bullet points are okay, too
 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
   single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here
 - Use a hanging indent
