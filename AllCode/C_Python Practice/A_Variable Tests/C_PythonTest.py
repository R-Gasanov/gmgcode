# An additional test will be made with variables in which variables will equal with one another

# As you can see from the first line of code, we made x equal to y which is equal to 50
x = y = (50)

print (x,y)
# Here we are showing that they are both 50
if x == 50 and y == 50:
# If that is the case, we will also test this with a if loop to see if the answers are indeed align
    z = x + y
    print (z) # This answer will also provide results since we are adding x+y which is 50+50
# With here we will get the answer we will need
print (f' We now know that x and y are equal to one another {z} since 50 + 50 = 100, meaning its true!')
# And thus finally we get the answer that we want
