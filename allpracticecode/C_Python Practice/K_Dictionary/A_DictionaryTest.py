# Now lets simply create a basic directionary to see what they have in store for us
cars = {
    'brand': 'Ford',
    'model': 'Mustang',
    'year': 1964
}
# Now lets evalutate what we can see here
print (cars)
# Our curly brackets essentially signify that this is indeed its a directionary since thats its one of its unique features
print ('####################')
# We have six different values, the ones of the left hand side are keys, which can be seen as subcatagories in our sakes
print (cars['brand'])
# On the right hand side though represent the values, which is what the subcatagories hold
print (cars['year'])
# So when we request a key to be printed, the values assigned to that key through the ':' will be shown
