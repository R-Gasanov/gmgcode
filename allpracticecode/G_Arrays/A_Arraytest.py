# This coding practice for me is to evaluate and see how the startswith string method operates to have a better understand why it did not fully operate within the code
words = ['EN16MA','17Good','01Quarter','1Heat','12text']
# We will be using arrays for this as well, just to be interersting
print = words[0]
# For now we will test he basics of Arrays
print ('#######################')
# What we can do as well
