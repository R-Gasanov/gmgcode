# Now we can't add new values within a tuple, but what we can do is merge two tuples together
alphabet = ('a','b','c')
# Here are too tuples that I've randomly constructed, one above and one below
numbers = (1, 2, 3)
# Its rather simple for us to add tuples together, its like basic mathmatical problems as shown below
a_tuple = alphabet + numbers
# We essentially create a new tuple that combines both of the other tuples
print (a_tuple)
# We can even multiply tuples which is fascinating, so lets continue with the similar basis we've done above
b_tuple = a_tuple*2
# We literally use the asterisk symbol, which allows to double the amount of values there are generally
print
# This is technically another way for us to edit a tuple, by creating a new one for it to be represented
print ('####################')
# This is essentially the end of the basics for tuples but, there are some built-in methods for tuples

 # count(alphabet)

# The count method allows us to show the numbers of specified value occured within a tuple

# index(numbers)

# position where it was found in the index
