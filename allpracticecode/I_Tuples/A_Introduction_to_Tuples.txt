Tuples

What we will be looking into, is specifically Tuples, these are used to store multiple different
items within a single variable. There are three other ways to store variables, from Lists, Sets
& Dictionarys. We will now currently be looking at tuples.

(Characteristics of Tuples)

The tuples characteristics are simple, its the usage of curved brackets.

(Tuple Items)

Tuple items are ordered are ordered in a specific way and unchanageble. They also additionally
allow duplicate values.

To find out the order of the items, Tuples are indexed, the first item has index [0] while
the next item is [1], and continues on in this cycle.

Since tuples orders are unchangable there is something distinct about them. They can have
duplicates, meaning they can have items with the same value.

Thats about it for the basics in tuples, we'll look into the actual coding and discuss more
about the Tuples in those code pieces.
