# Now first of lets begin our tests with Tuple, since they can store multiple values lets try it

atuple = ('China','America','United Kingdom','Russia','Poland')

print (atuple)
# As you can see when you review the atuple variable you can see the
print ('####################')
# Additionally as we have previously explained we can use duplicates

atuple_two = ('French','Czech Republic','Madagascar','French')

print (atuple_two)
# As you can see we can have duplicate values which is rather good for us
print ('####################')
# What we can even do is find the relative length of the Tuple
print(len(atuple_two))
# It prints out 4, meaning we have overall 4 different values within that Tuple
