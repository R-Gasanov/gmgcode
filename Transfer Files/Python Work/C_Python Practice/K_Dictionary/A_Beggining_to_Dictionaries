Dictionarys

Now what we will be looking into specifically is Dictionarys, they are unique compared to the rest
of the variable types there are. For one they can store values within pairs. Which essentially mean,
they can provide variables that are linked between one anothered. Which can be useful is specific terms.

(Characteristics of Dictionarys)

The dictionary characteristics are slightly more complicated. Using curly brackets and unique formatting to represent their
variables.

(Dictionary Items)

Dictionaries as only recently are ordered, meanwhile within python 3.6 and behind, they were unordered.

Whats interersting and well different compared to a Tuple, is that it is ordered yet changable. 
Meaning you can edit the contents within the Dictionary

Although you can't have duplicates of a dictionary, which is one of its attributes.

Dictionaries are by far written more differently and uniquely compared to the rest,
they have curly brackets which have a unique format since Dictionaries tend to hold more values than others.

They also have keys and values, which essentially link between each other, which can closely be resembled as
subcatagories.
