# Now that we have offically tried the basics of a Tuple, lets look at more of them
atuple = ('watermelon',)
print(type(atuple))
# As we remember, a type essentially evaluates what type of variable we are dealing with
notuple = ('watermelon')
print (type(notuple))
# For us to distinguise a tuple, it represent the next value in a tuple through a comma
print ('####################')
# As you can see the first variable is a tuple, since it distinguises the next value with a comma
atuple_two = (1,2,3,6,4,7,1,9)
# Whats great about a tuple is that it can store any data type, as you can see above
print (atuple_two)
# This can be very handy overall and whats good is that a tuple can hold different data types in one
atuple_three = ('Piano',18,False,'Chord',16)
# We have above a sting, integer and boolean within a single tuple, its rather handy in any-case
print (atuple_three)
# Tuples distinct variant is that its unchangable, only having what is initially stored which is useful
